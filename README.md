# `web3-ui-discord-github-supabase-auth-experiment`

This repo is an experiment for authenticating a user with Discord and GitHub and
storing the information in Supabase.

This experiment is a way for me to learn some essentials about the `web3-ui`,
Discord, GitHub, and Supabase APIs, and how to tie all of the information
together in order to authenticate a user and store their account information for
each service in Supabase.
